This folder contains files regarding my first submission on Kaggle.
I used the Titanic dataset to work on classifying which passengers onboard the Titanic survived.

I used a Decision Tree classifier to predict the survival of passengers based on their gender, class, embarkment port, etc.

This was quite informative, and I got a decent score of 0.76 for the same.
